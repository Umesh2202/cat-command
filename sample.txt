The dispute between Darnhall and Vale Royal Abbey arose in the early fourteenth century.
Tensions in Cheshire between villagers from Darnhall and Over and their feudal lord, Abbot Peter
Vale Royal Abbey, erupted into violence over whether they had villein—servile—status.
The villagers' efforts to reject the Abbey's feudal overlordship included appeals to the Abbot, the Justice of Chester and even to the King and Queen. On each occasion the villagers were unsuccessful, frequently suffering imprisonment and fines when their appeals failed.
